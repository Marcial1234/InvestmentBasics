## Real Estate
This is only if you got already a lot of CA$H already laying around, and enough to keep the desired properties maintained. You would need around 15% (or preferably more) of the property value in liquid (easy to cash) assets. 8% minimum for conventional loans, or 6% for FHA or Home Path Financing. Banks mostly take the offers from bidders with the less paperwork, as in no FHA or HomePath, and with most down payment. Best of luck getting  the latter loans in popular regions.
