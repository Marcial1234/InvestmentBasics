## Stock Market
Betting on spesific company stocks is rather risky. 
Here's a list of some online trading platforms where you can begin trading (some if not all have minimum deposit requirements):
* [Merril Edge](https://www.merrilledge.com/)
* [ETrade](https://us.etrade.com/home)
* [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/home.page)
* [OptionsHouse](http://www.optionshouse.com/)
* [TradeKing](https://www.tradeking.com/)
* [TradeMonster](https://www.trademonster.com/)
* [Scottrade](https://www.scottrade.com/)
* Etc

There's also [Robinhood](https://www.robinhood.com/) which is new platform with no commision fees and no minimum deposit to open.

## ETFs
[ETFs](http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/understanding-etfs/) are [index funds](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) that are traded like [stocks](http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/what-are-stocks/). These can be made to tracks an entire market instead of spefic comanies, making it them somewhat safer than buying a spesific company stock.

## P2P
P2P Lending is a new way of investing/borrowing on which regular people fund loans. The 'investors' in this case get a nifty interest on their money while the platform/loan facilitators charges. 2 very popular platforms that are available to the regular Joe are [Prosper](http://www.Prosper.com) and [LendingClub](http://www.LendingClub.com). Both charge a flat 1% service fee on collected payments.

## Real Estate
This is only if you got already a lot of CA$H already laying around, and enough to keep the desired properties maintained. You would need around 15% (or preferably more) of the property value in liquid (easy to cash) assets. 8% minimum for conventional loans, or 6% for FHA or Home Path Financing. Banks mostly take the offers from bidders with the less paperwork, as in no FHA or HomePath, and with most down payment. Best of luck getting  the latter loans in popular regions.
